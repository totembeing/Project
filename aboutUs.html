            <p><span>Apple Inc.</span> is an American multinational technology company that revolutionized the technology sector through its innovation of computer software, personal 
                computers, mobile tablets, smartphones, and computer peripherals.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most recognizable brands in the world, Apple created the first commercially successful personal computer and was also the first to bring the 
                graphical user interface (GUI) into mass adoption.
            </p>
            <p>
                Founded by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in 1976, Apple set new benchmarks in product innovation, user-centric functionality, aesthetics and design, and 
                multi-product integration. Apple redefined and transformed the capabilities of modern computing. Further, Apple innovated the industry by establishing a 
                marketplace ecosystem for third-party application developers, leveraging this new economy to expand its productsâ€™ functionalities and strengthen its position.
                The company is headquartered in Cupertino, California.

                <h2>Apple I</h2>
                <small>1976</small>
                <p>The Apple I, designed by Steve Wozniak in 1975, was an affordable, single-board computer with a 6502 processor and expandable RAM, priced at $666.66. 
                    Its success led to the formation of Apple Computers and helped pioneer mainstream personal computing.

                <small>1977</small>
                <p>The Apple II used a MOS 6502 chip for its central processing unit. It came with 4 KB RAM, but could be extended up to 48 KB RAM. It included a BASIC 
                    interpreter and could support graphics and a color monitor. External storage was originally on cassette tape, but later Apple introduced an external 
                    floppy disk drive.

                <h2>Macintosh 128K</h2>
                <small>1984</small>
                <p>The Macintosh (128k) was the first relatively inexpensive computer to use a graphical user interface, 3.5" disks, a consistent look-and-feel among 
                    applications, and true WYSIWYG printing, all of which are taken for granted today. This computer started a different way of thinking, allowing the user 
                    to concentrate on working rather than struggling to get the computer to work.

                <p>The Apple Macintosh Portable features a 16 MHz 68HC000 processor, 1 MB of RAM, a 1.44 MB floppy disk drive and the option of a 40 MB hard drive in a boxy 
                    portable case with a 9.8" monochrome active-matrix display. The Portable often was referred to as the "luggable" because it weighed nearly 16 pounds, but 
                    nevertheless, it still was a significant advance toward truly portable "laptop" or "notebook" computers.

                <p>The Apple Macintosh LC -- so named for its "Low Cost" compared to earlier color capable Macs -- features a 16 MHz 68020 processor, 2 MB or 4 MB of RAM, and 
                    either dual 1.44 MB disk drives or a single 1.44 MB disk drive and a 40 MB or an 80 MB hard drive in a compact, simple-to-upgrade "pizza box" case.

                <p>The Apple Macintosh PowerBook 100, co-designed by Apple and Sony, features a 16 MHz 68HC000 processor, 2 MB or 4 MB of RAM, and either a 20 MB or 40 MB hard 
                    drive in a compact portable case with a 9.0" monochrome passive-matrix display and an external floppy disk drive (not pictured). Essentially, the PowerBook 
                    100 is a redesigned version of the Backlit Portable in a smaller case that only weighs five pounds, a full ten pounds lighter than its predecessor.

                <p>The original Apple Newton MessagePad features a 20 MHz ARM 610 processor, 4 MB of ROM, 640k of SRAM (150k usable), and infrared-beaming capabilities in a 
                    compact handheld case with a 336x240 pressure-sensitive monochrome display for use with a provided stylus. The original Newton MessagePad was one of the 
                    first handheld systems, or PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants), to attempt to recognize natural handwriting and use a basic form of artificial intelligence 
                    to 'tie' relevant information together.
